# CipherDecryption
IMplementing Cipher Decryption algorithm using an evolutionary optimization as Genetic algorithm by training a language model with Markov approximation. Have implemented this Decryption algo with Trigrams,Bigrams,Unigrams probabilities included in matrices as part of training language model.Used Maximum Likelihood estimation for decoded messages to filter out messages which arent english.Basically, Log likelihood determines the whether decoded message is in proper english.

Future WIP:
To implement using RNN models for comparison
